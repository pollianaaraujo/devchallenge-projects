<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/LtZFqny.png)

I started learning HTML and CSS a few months ago, so I decided to do an exercise from devchallenge to practice a little what I learned so far.

I had some difficulty working on a responsive page, but I think I managed to deliver a nice page.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
